# MolE molecular representation through redundancy reduced embeddings

MolE representations (Molecular representation through redundancy reduced Embeddings) are task-independent, learned molecular embeddings generated through a self-supervised deep learning approach. They are designed to encode chemically meaningful information about molecules without needing labeled training data.

This model was incorporated on 2025-06-23.Last packaged on 2025-10-07.
