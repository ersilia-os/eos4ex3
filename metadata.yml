Title: MolE molecular representation through redundancy reduced embeddings
Description: MolE representations (Molecular representation through redundancy 
  reduced Embeddings) are task-independent, learned molecular embeddings 
  generated through a self-supervised deep learning approach. They are designed 
  to encode chemically meaningful information about molecules without needing 
  labeled training data.
